## Project Description

The capstone project is about solving a problem when it comes to charity.
Many people are reluctant to donate to charity organisations because they feel like their money will not reach the people who actually need it,
but rather it will be lost in administration fees, bad management, corruption, favouritism, lack of local knowledge, high expenses etc. etc.
but they would still like to help people in need.

This is where my project comes in.

It is a sort of LinkedIn/Tinder/Facebook of Charity.    It let's you find, connect and DIRECTLY donate to needy people.

 Selected trusted organisations and individuals, mosques, churches etc. will be able to register people in their communities on my website ( and app in the future) who they know are the most in need of help.

 The donors can then adjust their filter according to what they want/who specifically they would like to help most. (examples of categories: most vulnerable, emergencies, medical treatment, orphans, widows, disabled, natural disasters, famine, refugees, children, partnership in a business idea, school fees, sponsorship of education fees, zakat/religious contribution etc. etc. also by age, gender, new profiles, people who have not received donations yet, filter by country, region etc.)

 They will then be able to see all the profiles according to their search query(or just randomised if the don't have specific requirements) and can then go through them and see all the personal details, fotos, stories, description and bank details to make a direct transfer, and there might be an apportunity to chat or interact and also receive pictures of the people actually receiving the money in cash or receipts of school fees paid etc.
